## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using World Happiness report data from 2015 and 2016 (though the analysis can be extended to the later years) to better understand the following:

1. What makes countries happier?
2. Is the notion of happiness the same across the world?
3. What explains increasing or decreasing happiness over the years?


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is a Juptyer notebooks in this repository to showcase the work related to the above questions.  The notebook is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title. To assist with the thought process of creating the notebook, markdown cells were used.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@vigyaan/what-does-happiness-means-across-the-world-1e5655776279).

The data comes from the World happiness report published each year by the UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network. The surveys resulting in the data are done by Gallup World Poll.  The data can be downloaded at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/unsdsn/world-happiness). This project is licensed under the terms of the MIT license.
